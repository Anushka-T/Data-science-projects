# Data Science Portfolio

A repository containing my data science projects, presented as iPython Notebooks. Where possible, data used in the project and models created by me have also been shared. 

## Project list

### [Automated malaria diagnosis](https://github.com/AnushkaThawani/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Malaria_detect_classify)

- **Area**: computer vision
- **Summary**: Malaria is traditionally diagnosed by microscopic examination of blood smear slides. Here, I design a pipeline that can automatically detect and identify infected red blood cells in microscopy images and output diagnostic and other clinically relevant information.
- **Learnt**: how to fine-tune a pretrained DEtection TRansformer (DETR) model and create a custom convolutional neural network to solve an object detection and classification task 
- **Tools**: PyTorch, object-oriented programming (OOP), imgaug and cv2

### [Wikipedia comment moderator](https://github.com/AnushkaThawani/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Wikipedia_comment_moderator)

- **Area**: natural language processing
- **Summary**: Creating a comment classifier that can effectively handle nuanced and contextual language will be a crucial step towards the development of more automated content moderation systems. In this project, I created a model that can detect toxic comments and accurately identify different types of toxicity, such as hate speech, threats and obscenity.
- **Learnt**: how to represent text as fixed-length vectors known as bag-of-words
- **Tools**: Keras, Scikit Learn, NLTK
